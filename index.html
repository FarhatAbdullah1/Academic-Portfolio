    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>An active career in teaching and research spanning over a decade includes service at various higher education institutions in both teaching and research roles. Participating in the DAAD-funded Urdu WordNet project (2012) provided a significant learning experience. Since joining the University of Central Punjab, Lahore, as a permanent faculty member in 2013, I have been teaching a range of linguistics courses such as Introduction to Language Studies, Sociolinguistics, Semantics, TESOL, and Forensic Linguistics. My teaching abilities, discipline, and innovative pedagogical skills have been recognized with the Best Faculty Teacher Award for 2021. Leadership and managerial skills are regularly utilized through organizing poster presentations, seminars, and study tours within the English department. Research papers have been presented at numerous international conferences, both in Pakistan and abroad, earning the HEC International Travel Grant twice, in 2013 and 2016. Attendance at CoLang 2016 in Fairbanks, Alaska, USA, contributed to certification in language documentation. For the PhD, the Higher Education Commission (HEC) of Pakistan awarded a Faculty Development Program Scholarship in 2018. This period also included a research fellowship at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore, where teaching experience at the undergraduate level was gained. Membership in the Linguistic Society of America afforded the opportunity to participate in SALT 31 and FASL 30, organized by Brown University and MIT, USA. My focus remains on the Semantics-Syntax interface within the field of linguistics. </p>
